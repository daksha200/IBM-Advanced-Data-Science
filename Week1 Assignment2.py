# # Warmup Assignment 2
# Below you see some ApacheSpark code written in Python. You don't have to change code now, the only thing we want you to do is to make sure that you have a proper Apache Spark Notebook environment available for this course
# 
# 

# This notebook is designed to run in a IBM Watson Studio default runtime (NOT the Watson Studio Apache Spark Runtime as the default runtime with 1 vCPU is free of charge). Therefore, we install Apache Spark in local mode for test purposes only. Please don't use it in production.
# 
# In case you are facing issues, please read the following two documents first:
# 
# https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/Environment-Setup
# 
# https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/FAQ
# 
# Then, please feel free to ask:
# 
# https://coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-big-data-apache-spark/discussions/all
# 
# Please make sure to follow the guidelines before asking a question:
# 
# https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/FAQ#im-feeling-lost-and-confused-please-help-me
# 
# 
# If running outside Watson Studio, this should work as well. In case you are running in an Apache Spark context outside Watson Studio, please remove the Apache Spark setup in the first notebook cells.
